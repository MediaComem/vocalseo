## Documentation
This tool helps to build queries for Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri. It generates automatically audio files for each query (`textQueries` textarea) and each assistant.

It use Google Text To Speech [client library](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-client-libraries) to generate audio files. This needs Google Cloud Platform specific configuration and authentication. The authentication environment variables comes from the credentials JSON generated.

You can add, update or remove *Assistants* on `querybuilder.js` file by updating `assistants` array.

You can add, update or remove *Language Code* on on `index.pug` file by updating `languageCode` select tag.

Voices are retrieved with [Google TTS API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/v1/voices/list).

‚ö†Ô∏è There is a CRON job which removes each audio files in `/outputs` directory at 3am everyday. However, we remove the old files when we start the server because Heroku (Free tier) sleeps when CRON should start.
